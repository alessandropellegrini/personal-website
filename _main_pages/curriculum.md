## National/International Projects

I have been involved in the following list of national/international research projects.


{% include project.html dates="2020 &rarr; 2022"
                      acronym="SISMA"
                      name="Solutions for Engineering Microservice Architectures"
                      grant="PRIN 2017, Grant Agreement #201752ENYB"
                      funding="640 K€"
                      description="The SISMA project focuses on the improvement of the design of test cases for distributed software systems abiding by the microservices paradigm. Areas of interest of the studyconcern: strategies for the aggregation of test cases,  algorithms to select and prioritise elements in a set of test cases, composition strategies of functional and non-functional aspects for exploring alternative operating conditions. The structured and reusable design of testing bundles would increase the quality of the test suites, and their level of automation as well. Also, a workflow-based planning of test cases would contribute to the incremental development of end-to-end tests, and to the enactment of dynamic strategies for governing regression testing activities."

                      acronym="SPARTA"
                      name="Strategic Programs for Advanced Research and Technology in Europe"
                      grant="EU H2020 Project, Grant Agreement #830892"
                      funding="16 M€"
                      description="The digital era has brought with it many advantages for mankind, but the issue of secure data exchange remains among the most significant concerns. The EU-funded SPARTA project is bringing together a unique set of actors at the crossroads of scientific excellence, technological innovation and social sciences to address the issue of cybersecurity. The project aims to set up unique collaborations, build transformative capabilities and form world-leading expertise centres. Through innovative governance, ambitious demonstration cases and active community engagement, SPARTA intends to re-think the way cybersecurity research is performed in Europe across various domains and fields of expertise."

                      funding="1 M€"
                      description="The goal of the EvoATM project is to model ATM system in the Free Route scenario, combining an agent based simulation paradigm with Evolutionary Computing optimization techniques to understand the influence of ATM components and parameters on the behaviour at whole system performances level. By using quantitative indicators, EvoATM has opened the way to more efficient change impact assessment, supporting design and strategic thinking in ATM evolution."
