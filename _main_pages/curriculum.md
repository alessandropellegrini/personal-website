## National/International Projects

I have been involved in the following list of national/international research projects.

{% include project.html dates="2023 &rarr; current"
                      acronym="DOMAIN"
                      name="Taming Heterogeneous Computing Complexity with Full-Stack Governance of Domain-Specific Languages"

                      grant="PRIN 2022, Grant Agreement #2022TSYYKJ"
                      role="Principal Investigator"
                      funding="190 K€"
                      description="The DOMAIN Project aims to address the growing complexity in computing hardware architectures. With the transition to heterogeneous systems combining general-purpose and specialized computing units, the project focuses on developing high-level, semantically-rich abstractions that are accessible and efficient for domain experts across various fields. By exploring Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and creating new compiling toolchains, software runtime environments, and operating system supports, the project seeks to optimize large-scale heterogeneous platforms. The goal is to allow domain experts to efficiently code applications, leveraging the full potential of these complex architectures with minimal technical involvement."

                      funding="910 K€"
                      description="The SISMA project focuses on the improvement of the design of test cases for distributed software systems abiding by the microservices paradigm. Areas of interest of the studyconcern: strategies for the aggregation of test cases,  algorithms to select and prioritise elements in a set of test cases, composition strategies of functional and non-functional aspects for exploring alternative operating conditions. The structured and reusable design of testing bundles would increase the quality of the test suites, and their level of automation as well. Also, a workflow-based planning of test cases would contribute to the incremental development of end-to-end tests, and to the enactment of dynamic strategies for governing regression testing activities."

                      description="The digital era has brought with it many advantages for mankind, but the issue of secure data exchange remains among the most significant concerns. The EU-funded SPARTA project is bringing together a unique set of actors at the crossroads of scientific excellence, technological innovation and social sciences to address the issue of cybersecurity. The project aims to set up unique collaborations, build transformative capabilities and form world-leading expertise centres. Through innovative governance, ambitious demonstration cases and active community engagement, SPARTA intends to re-think the way cybersecurity research is performed in Europe across various domains and fields of expertise."
