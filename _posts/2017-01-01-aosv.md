Course Objectives and Exam Rules
--------------------------------

The *Advanced Operating Systems and Virtualization* course aims at presenting
advanced design/implementation methods and techniques for modern Operating
Systems, including the support for system virtualization, and several security
aspects. 
The topics dealt with in the course are bound to case studies oriented to Linux
systems and x86 processors. During the course, we will see the internals from
Linux 2.4, 2.6, 3.0, and 4.0.

The course requires basic knowledge of the organisation and services offered by
modern Operating Systems, of data structures, and of C/assembly programming.
Some insights on the x86 computing architectures will help at bootstrapping the
new topics shown in the course. 

The exam consists of a written test and a practical project. The project
requires the student to develop some new services within the Linux kernel. The
specification of the project will be given during the course.

After a student has passed the written test, a one-year grace period to hand
off the project is allowed. The final mark is the weighted average of the scores
obtained at the written test and at the project. The written test is worth 2/5
of the final mark, while the project is worth 3/5 of the final mark.
Rejecting the final mark is possible, but requires the student to pass the written
test again.
