Course Objectives
-----------------

The Data Centers and High Performance Computing course aims at inroducing how to organize and effectively use high-end systems. To this end, modern computing architectures are first discussed at a single-chip level, with a special focus on massively-parallel architectures. Modern paradigms for concurrent and distributed programming are explained, which allow to fully exploit these modern architectures. The typical organization of data centers which host generic applications (such as web and data management ones) is presented, along with concepts related to their design and management. Emphasis will be given to the relationship between this organization and the Cloud Computing paradigm. The course will address as well topics related to transparency towards parallelism and distribution. Some topics will be associated with seminars given by renowned international companies.


Exam Rules
----------

The exam is divided in two parts: a written test (5 questions, 2.30 hours) which will give 3/5 of the final mark; a practical project (2/5 of the final mark). The written test must be passed before starting the starting to work on the project.

We will record who attends the seminars. In case less than 60% of the seminars are attended, an additional essay on one of the topics presented at the seminars will be requested.
